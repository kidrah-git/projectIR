Real Madrid, is a football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.
Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was given by King Alfonso XIII in 1920, as well as the crown being added to the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity[8] Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. Its anthem is the "Hala Madrid y nada más".[9] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, is the most followed football club on social media,[10][11] and was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[12] In 2024, Madrid became the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.1bn) in revenue.[13]
In domestic football, the club have won 71 trophies: a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[14] In international football, Real Madrid have won a record 34 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Real Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[18] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[19][20]
Madrid is one of the three La Liga clubs alongside Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929. Real Madrid have many long-standing rivalries, most notably the El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and a total six European Cups as well as two reaching two finals. This success was replicated domestically, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento, and Raymond Kopa is considered by many to be the greatest of all time.[21][22] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[23] The policy generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency (2000–06 and 2009–18); however, some players before his tenure are considered to be Galácticos, such as Steve McManaman.[24] In June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[25] he became the all-time top goalscorer for the club and in football.[26][27][28][29] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham,[30] and Kylian Mbappé
